Description: Improves the balance of optimal matching with near-fine balance by giving penalties on the unbalanced covariates with the unbalanced directions. Many directional penalties can also be viewed as Lagrange multipliers, pushing a matched sample in the direction of satisfying a linear constraint that would not be satisfied without penalization.

Note: One minimum cost flow problem may have several or many solutions that are equivalent in providing the same minimum total or mean cost. Minor differences between computers or implementations may have the minor consequence of altering which equivalent solution is produced.
